## Legacy features

Gohan used to support a number of features that are now considered legacy. This list includes:

- file (json/yaml) based database
- SNMP
- AMQP
- Golang extensions (superseeded by Golang Plugins)
- Own scripting language (Gohanscript)
- ETCDv2 (superseeded by ETCDv3)

These features are still available in the v1.0.0 tag 
(cf. https://github.com/cloudwan/gohan/blob/v1.0.0/README.md), 
though they are not actively maintained.
